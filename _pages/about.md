I am a 3rd Ph.D. student at VACT lab in Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University, supervised by Dr. [Lingyun Yu](https://yulingyun.com/). My research focuses on Scientific Visualization (SciVis) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My work is dedicated to design and evaluate the spatial interaction techniques and visualization techniques tailored to specific scientific domains including astronomy and biomedicine within Cross-Reality (CR) and Virtual Reality (VR) environments.
